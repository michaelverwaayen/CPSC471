				<h2> Mission Statement </h2>
				<h3> Healthcare is a database management system focussed on access control because <br>
				our patrons information is what matters most to us.  </h3>
				<h4> We protect our users information by making sure that only the physicians or healthcare workers <br>
					directly in contact with you have any access to your records. This ensures that no one not qualified <br>
					or not helping you will see your information, keeping your private medically history to yourself.<br>
