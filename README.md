The php i believe to be pretty much done we need the SQL posted here WITH WHAT ALL THE VARIABLES MEAN. Cause it is a bit confusing as of right now with the queries...

WE HAVE TO MAKE THE HTML OF KEY FUNCTIONS NOW AND TRY TO DEBUG SO WE CAN HAND SOMETHING IN FOR THURSDAY...

What functions are necessary for the key presentation?
1.) patient can view their records
2.) doctor can search their patients
3.) nurse can look at drug records 
4.) pharmacist can look at drugs and fill it 
5.) We still need sql and what not to edit information... currently doctors can only search ????
